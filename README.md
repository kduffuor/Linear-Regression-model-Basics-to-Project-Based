# Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn: From Basics to Healthcare Cost Prediction
This work demonstrates how to apply linear regression using Python and scikit-learn, starting from a simple synthetic example and progressing to a real-world healthcare dataset.

## What it Covers
### Part 1: Linear Regression Basics
- Model training and prediction
- Evaluation using Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score
- Plotting regression line

### Part 2: Medical Cost Prediction (Mini Project)
- EDA
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Splitting into train/test sets
- Model training and evaluation
- Actual vs Predicted cost visualization

## Techniques & Tools Used
- **Python**
- **scikit-learn** (LinearRegression, train_test_split, metrics, OneHotEncoder)
- **pandas** for data handling
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for visualization

## Next Steps
- Extend to Polynomial Regression
- Try regularization (Ridge, Lasso)
- Explore healthcare datasets with more features or classification tasks
